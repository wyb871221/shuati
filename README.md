Array category algorithm takeaways:

1. If there's a range for the defined numbers in the array, create an array with numbers of the range
eg. range given to you is integer from 0 to 10000, create an array with 10000 elements, this way you can achieve sorting in O(n) time
eg 561.java

2. If the range given by the problem is positive integer, then you can achieve O(1) space by using negative integer as a visited mark.
eg. 442.java

3. Subarray series
