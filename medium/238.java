238. Product of Array Except Self

Given an array of n integers where n > 1, nums, return an array output such that output[i] is equal to the product of all the elements of nums except nums[i].

Solve it without division and in O(n).

For example, given [1,2,3,4], return [24,12,8,6].

Follow up:
Could you solve it with constant space complexity? (Note: The output array does not count as extra space for the purpose of space complexity analysis.)

Given numbers [2, 3, 4, 5], regarding the third number 4, the product of array except 4 is 2*3*5 which consists of two parts: left 2*3 and right 5. The product is left*right. We can get lefts and rights:

Numbers:     2    3    4     5
Lefts:            2  2*3 2*3*4
Rights:  3*4*5  4*5    5      
Let’s fill the empty with 1:

Numbers:     2    3    4     5
Lefts:       1    2  2*3 2*3*4
Rights:  3*4*5  4*5    5     1
We can calculate lefts and rights in 2 loops. The time complexity is O(n).

We store lefts in result array. If we allocate a new array for rights. The space complexity is O(n). To make it O(1), we just need to store it in a variable which is
